# AirbnbRiodeJaneiro
This is a Jupyter project analysing Airbnb data from Rion de Janeiro's listings for my Data Scientist Nanodegree Project from Udacity.

In this project we inspect two dataframes with Rio de Janeiros's listings information from February 2021 to investigate the following questions:
1) How many neighborhoods were listed in Rio de Janeiro?
2) What was the most listed type of room in Rio de Janeiro? 
3) What was the 10 most listed neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro?
4) What was the the total listings during the Carnival holidays in 2021 in Rio de Janeiro? 
5) What was the average price to book a room during the period of the Carnival hollidays in Rio de Janeiro?

I used python 3, and the libraries pandas and matplotlib to plot the graphics.

It was a rich experience of learning! Feel free to collaborate!
