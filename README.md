# AirbnbRiodeJaneiro

# Motivation

This is a Jupyter project analysing Airbnb data from Rion de Janeiro's listings for my Data Scientist Nanodegree Project from Udacity.
We are investigating if Airbnb is a good option to book a room in Rio de Janeiro during the Carnival Holiday. We are going to answer this following questios:

In this project we inspect two dataframes with Rio de Janeiros's listings information from February 2021 to investigate the following questions:
1) How many neighborhoods were listed in Rio de Janeiro?
2) What was the most listed type of room in Rio de Janeiro? 
3) What was the 10 most listed neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro?
4) What was the the total listings during the Carnival holidays in 2021 in Rio de Janeiro? 
5) What was the average price to book a room during the period of the Carnival hollidays in Rio de Janeiro?

# Installation

I used python 3, and the libraries pandas and matplotlib to plot the graphics.

The files used were obtained from : insideairbnb.com. 
  - calendar.csv  : Detailed Calendar Data for listings in Rio de Janeiro
  - listings.csv : Summary Review data and Listing ID  
  
# Results

In this project we could see the 10 most listed neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro, the most listed one being Copacabana.  
We could also calculate the average price of the listings in Rio de Janeiro in 2020, and see that the most listed type of rooms 
is the type of entire room or apartment.

From the information gathered in this project, we could see that Airbnb is a good option to book a room in Rio de Janeiro.
